# SQL Command Line Employee Tracker

## Description
This is an SQL command line application that allows a user to use an employee content management system. A user can choose to view departments, roles, and employees, add departments, roles, and employees, update the role of an employee, or exit the application.

## NOTE
I used code that was corrected/supplied by the Xpert Learning Assistant in the functions to perform queries and to start the application. This application was also debugged by a Learning Assistant to get the database to properly connect.
